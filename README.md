About : This repo contains code for Hashing an array of size N with worst case search time guarantee of O(1). Total memory used by the code is N + o(N). 

How to use : Code is written in c++. Compile it using flag -std=c++0x. Example - 'g++ code.cpp -o code -std=c++0x". file `simple.cpp` uses simple hashing technique. file code.cpp actually implimnets 'Universal Hashing' with space optimization. Read this paper - http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~ac/Teach/CS105-Winter05/Handouts/fks-perfecthash.pdf. To use it as project - copy paste the whole code. Create a vector of elements to be hashed. Declare the class. Pass the vector as an argument. Then for query, classname.Contains(key) will return 1 if the key is present, otherwise returns zero. A driver function is written in the code to understand it better.
